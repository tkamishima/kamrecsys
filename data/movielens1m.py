Convert MovieLens 1M data sets to PyRecSys Sample format

Instruction
-----------

1. Download original file, ml-1m.zip, from `MovieLens Data Sets
   <http://www.grouplens.org/node/73>`_.
2. Unpack this ml-1m.zip, and place the following files at this directory:
   ratings.dat, users.dat, movies.dat
3. Run this script. As default, converted files are generated at
   ../pyrecsys/datasets/samples/ directory. If you want change the target
   directory, you need to specify it as the first argument of this script.
4. Remove original files, if you do not need them.
