This directory contains converters for benchmark data sets that are publicly available. 

To use sample loader of `KamRecSys`, you need to download files from the original sites.
By running a corresponding script, you will be able to get converted files at the target directory, as default `kamrecsys/datasets/samples/`.
You can find instructions printed by `<SCRIPT> --help`.
