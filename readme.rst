PyRecSys
********

``PyRecSys`` is a python package of algorithms for recommender systems.

This package targets experimental algorithm used for research purpose.
We concentrate on the flexibility of data structure or easiness for implementing new algorithm rather than scalablity or efficiency of algorithms.
